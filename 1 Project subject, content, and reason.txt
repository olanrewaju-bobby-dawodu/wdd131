Subject:
Independent Musicians and Their Creative Journeys

✏️
Succinctly describe the planned content of the website:
A website that showcases the creative processes, styles, and personal inspirations of independent musicians. Rather than using clickable links, the site will reveal insights through hover-based popups tied to artist images and interactive content areas. To maintain privacy, pseudonyms and royalty-free stock images will be used where necessary.

🎯
The reason you chose this subject:
I’m passionate about music and fascinated by how musicians express their creativity. I once came across a visually interactive music site that inspired me, and now I want to build a unique version of it that celebrates artistic individuality without compromising user experience.
