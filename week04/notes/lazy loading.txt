Image Loading Behavior in HTML
To optimize loading performance on a web page, you can delay the loading of certain images by using the loading="lazy" attribute. This instructs the browser to wait until the image is about to enter the viewport before downloading it.


<img
  src="images/anyphoto.jpg"
  alt="Descriptive text for meaningful image"
  loading="lazy"
  width="300"
  height="500">
The lazy value tells the browser: “Only load this when the user scrolls near it.”

This is useful for off-screen images, such as those below the fold.

By contrast, loading="eager" loads the image right away. This is the default behavior, so there's typically no need to specify it.

 Optional: Add a Fade-In Effect with CSS
To enhance the user experience, you can pair lazy loading with a fade-in animation using CSS:


img[loading="lazy"] {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 1s ease-in;
}

img[loading="lazy"].loaded {
  opacity: 1;
}
Then in JavaScript, detect when the image finishes loading:


document.querySelectorAll('img[loading="lazy"]').forEach(img => {
  img.addEventListener('load', () => {
    img.classList.add('loaded');
  });
});
