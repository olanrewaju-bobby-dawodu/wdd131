                Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret
                works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us - not our slaves, but our brethren and
                partners of all our substance.

                Alma 44:5-7
            </h2>
            <p>
                And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms
                that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by
                our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which
                binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to
                which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us -

                Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up
                your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will
                go your way and come not again to war against us.

                And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall
                upon you, and inflict the wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will
                see who shall have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.
